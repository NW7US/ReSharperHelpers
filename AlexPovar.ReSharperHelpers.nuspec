Version 3.0.1
  Fix capitalization typo in name.
    
Version 3.0
  The major change is that plugin has been renamed to have more friendly name.
  
  New features:
    - Add "Launch Solution" build action that triggers a solution build before the startup project is run.
      Useful, if you want to ensure that the "always build" projects are indeed always built before run.
    - Use `[assembly: AssemblyMetadata("ReSharperHelpers.TestProject", "TEST_PROJECT_NAME")]` attribute to configure test project on project level.
      Refer to the project site to find more detail.
    - Allow to configure test suffix to use when a new test is created (see settings page).
    - Allow to specify test suffixes to use when matching existing tests (see settings page).
      
  Improvements:
    - Project warning suppression feature has been improved to suppress highlights even when you have solution specific settings for them. 
    
Version 2.1
  New features:
    - Section navigation (using Ctrl + Up/Down) now jumps in the middle of large sections.
    - Use `[assembly: SuppressMessage("ReSharper", "id of message")]` attribute to suppress warnings on project level. Useful for test projects.
      Note, you might need to reload solution and re-analyze files to apply changes.
  
  Misc:
    - Update R# SDK to 2012.2.2.
    
Version 2.0
  New features:
    - Use Ctrl + Up/Down to navigate to next section in Alt-Enter menu.
    - [AutoFixture] Add freeze by criteria and actions to remove attributes.
    
  Improvements:
    - Improve test project detection logic. No need to configure feature now.
    - Change options position.
