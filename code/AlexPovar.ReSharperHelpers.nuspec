  Add support for R# 2017.2.

  Improvements:
    - Enhance the "Copy full class name" action to resolve assembly name more accurately.

Version 4.2
  Add support for R# 2017.1
  
Version 4.1
  Improvements:
    - Allow to copy full interface type using quick action.
    - Add more signatures to recognize test classes and projects.

Version 4.0
  Add support for R# 2016.3.

      Now it's a part of R#, no need to support it separately.
      
  Changed features:
    - Cleanup modified files
      Removed status bar update with number of processed items. That was done to not bind to VS specific API.
    
Version 3.0.1
  Fix capitalization typo in name.
    
Version 3.0
  The major change is that plugin has been renamed to have more friendly name.
  
  New features:
    - Add "Launch Solution" build action that triggers a solution build before the startup project is run.
      Useful, if you want to ensure that the "always build" projects are indeed always built before run.
    - Use `[assembly: AssemblyMetadata("ReSharperHelpers.TestProject", "TEST_PROJECT_NAME")]` attribute to configure test project on project level.
      Refer to the project site to find more detail.
    - Allow to configure test suffix to use when a new test is created (see settings page).
    - Allow to specify test suffixes to use when matching existing tests (see settings page).
      
  Improvements:
    - Project warning suppression feature has been improved to suppress highlights even when you have solution specific settings for them. 
    
Version 2.1
  New features:
    - Section navigation (using Ctrl + Up/Down) now jumps in the middle of large sections.
    - Use `[assembly: SuppressMessage("ReSharper", "id of message")]` attribute to suppress warnings on project level. Useful for test projects.
      Note, you might need to reload solution and re-analyze files to apply changes.
  
  Misc:
    - Update R# SDK to 2012.2.2.
    
Version 2.0

    - Use Ctrl + Up/Down to navigate to next section in Alt-Enter menu.
